# House_Price_Prediction
The House Price Prediction project utilizes regularized linear regression to predict house prices based on various features. It aims to provide accurate price estimates for real estate transactions, helping both buyers and sellers make informed decisions.


## Features
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Selection: Select relevant features from the dataset that contribute significantly to house price prediction.

Regularized Linear Regression: Implement regularized linear regression algorithms such as Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the regularization parameter using techniques like cross-validation to achieve better model performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Utilize appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error or root mean squared error to assess model performance.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data samples.


## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas,  Matplotlib

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
